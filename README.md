# pet-store

This pet-store is a 3-tier application for an online pet store. It provides the following features:

* users are able to see which pets are available for purchase
* staff can add new pets to the pet storeâ€™s inventory
* staff can remove pets that have been sold

## storefront

In the ``storefront`` folder you will find an Angular.js application implementing the front-end.

This project was initialized with anglular-cli by running ``ng new --routing  --skip-git  --style=scss storefront``

## pet-services

In the ``pet-services`` folder you will find a spring boot RESTful web service supporting the back-end and data tiers of the application.

It uses the most recent version of spring boot, version 2.0.1

This project was initialized by running ``./bin/springboot pet-services``
